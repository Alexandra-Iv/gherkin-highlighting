gherkin-highlighting
====================

Adding syntax highlighting for your Cucumber feature files in Notepad++.
It is based on the new UDL2 that is officially part of the Notepad++ 6.2+ build.

Pre-requisites: 
Notepad version 6.2+

How?
-Download the file "feature_udl.xml" file from this project.
-In Notepad++ open the Language menu and select the "Define your language..." option.
-In the "User Defined Language v2.0" dialog box, click on the "Import..." button.
-Select the "feature_udl.xml" file you downloaded in the first step.
-After the import succeeded, close the dialog box.

At this point, any file with the extension .feature opened in Notepad++ will have its syntax lighlighted.


You can customise the syntax highligthing (i.e. change the colors, fonts,...) aftrwards.
