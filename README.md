Add syntax highlighting for your Cucumber feature files in Notepad++
====================================================================

If you write your specifications/tests with Cucumber in the Notepad++ editor,
then adding syntax highlighting for your feature files to your favourite editor is a must.

With the XML file provided here, Notepad++ will emphasize feature file elements such as:
@tags, \#comments, keywords like Scenario, Given, When, Then..


Pre-requisites
--------------
Notepad version 6.2+

Installation
------------
- Download the file "feature_udl.xml" file from this project.
- In Notepad++ open the Language menu and select the "Define your language..." option.
- In the "User Defined Language v2.0" dialog box, click on the "Import..." button.
- Select the "feature_udl.xml" file you downloaded in the first step.
- After the import succeeded, close the dialog box.

At this point, any file with the extension .feature opened in Notepad++ will have its syntax lighlighted.


Customization
-------------
The "feature_udl.xml" file is formatted for the new UDL2 (User-Defined Language) interface that is officially part of the Notepad++ 6.2+ build.
It offers more flexibility than the older language-extension of Notepad++.
You can customise the syntax highligthing (i.e. change the colors, fonts,...) any time after the installation.

For more details about UDL2, consult its documentation at:
